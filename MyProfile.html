      <h1 class="sectionContent"> Technology is something that I have been interested about since young, so the decision to study Information Technology in RMIT University came naturally. Technology is immerging over the years and fortunately, I am in the right era to be able to learn and observe how big of an impact echnology has on the world today. My interest started when I was in high school learning about how cloud services can affect the future work force or even benefit companies that are venturing into technology. That made me want to learn more about the fundamentals behind it. Where technology will potentially be in 20 years’ time intrigues me, and it’s exciting to be in involved in technology because it allows me to point my career in any direction.      </h1>
        <h1 class="sectionContent">The person who has inspired me the most is my uncle who is the Senior Client Executive/Director at a large IT company. He has never failed to give me advice on what skills and courses are in demand by IT companies which will broaden my opportunities. </h1>


      <h1 class="sectionContent">I chose to pursue my degree in RMIT because it is a modern university that offers a wide range of practical experiences instead of just theory. RMIT also focuses on work internship that will be beneficial to me when I’m out in the work force. RMIT also has a strong focus on preparing students on emerging trends, which will equip me with the necessary skills for my future.
        </li>
      </h1>

      <h1 class="sectionContent">I expect to learn new skills that will not only be beneficial to me in the working world, but also help me develop as a student in the university. Studying in this course will help me to discover what I’m passionate about and learn how to adapt to changes. It will encourage me to reflect on my best qualities as well as my weaknesses, and to build my self-confidence along the way.

     <p class="sectionContent">The position I choose to pursue in is cloud security. What makes this position appealing to me is how cloud services influence businesses by enhancing security and enabling them to cut back on risks. Cloud computing has many different areas but the one that is most enticing to me is how cloud security can defence a country. Cloud security is a fast expanding service that offers mostly the same process as a typical IT security firm, including preventing data leakage and staying ahead of risks in the cloud environment.</p>
     <p class="sectionContent"> Skills required for this position range from knowing the fundamentals of how cloud security operates to detecting threats in the system. Having an educational background in IT will give me the necessary expertise for this role. Gaining experience and exposure from internship relating to the cloud security industry will also be useful for this position.</p>
     <p class="sectionContent">I am currently a student pursuing a Bachelor’s degree, majoring in IT at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology. Having previously worked as an admin assistant as well as a desktop support assistant has helped me become more comfortable with working in a team and strengthened my communication skills. With a positive attitude and a good work ethic I believe I can spearhead any enterprise forward.</p>
     <p class="sectionContent">To obtain the required skills for this job, I will be taking online courses on cloud computing, Amazon Web Services (AWS) and artificial intelligence. Not only will this broaden my knowledge, but it will also give me insights on how the industry operates. I will also take up an internship position at an IT firm during my holidays. This is to increase my chances of getting hired by boosting up the employer’s confidence in trusting me with the position. Furthermore, I will expand my network by going to IT related events and meeting people who are working in the sector.</p>

     <p class="sectionContent"> According to the Myers-Briggs test, I am an ISTJ which indicates that I score higher on introversion, sensing, thinking and judging. This means that I learn best and enjoy being in calm surroundings. Being a sensor also means that I possess strong attention to detail. Furthermore, I tend to have logical rationale behind my decisions. Lastly, I will more likely stick to a plan I have created and follow a schedule rather than do tasks spontaneously.<p class="sectionContent">According to an online learning style test, I am a visual learner which means I learn best with visual aids such as diagrams, graphs, or charts. I also tend to gravitate towards learning materials that allow me to see and picture what I am learning, instead of demanding me to read it.</p>
     <p class="sectionContent">According to the Big Five Personality Test, the big five factors are Openness to experience, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Natural reactions. Having scored low in openness to experience shows that I am a traditional person who is down to earth and practical. Scoring average in conscientiousness means that I am in between being flexible and disciplined when it comes to my work ethics. I am also in the 37th percentile in terms of extraversion, meaning that I can be reserved and serious but also friendly and assertive. Having scored extremely low in agreeableness means that I am a competitive person, especially in my work environment. The test also shows that I am not easily upset in stressful situations, according to my natural reactions.</p>
     <p class="sectionContent">The results of these tests has helped me understand myself better as an individual by illustrating my personality in different ways. I will be able to utilize these results as an advantage to control my thinking and steer it in the direction that can help me achieve my goal. The results also showed me how I would learn best, which will allow me to adjust my learning method so that I can absorb information more efficiently.</p>
     <p class="sectionContent">These results will make me more conscious of my actions and how they may affect other people in the team. I will also attempt to soften my personality aspect which do not necessarily do well in a group setting. </p>
     <p class="sectionContent">Although it would be easier to look for group members who are on the same wavelength, it is important for a team to have diversity. Therefore, I would form a team with members who have different personalities, encouraging the team to have unique ideas. Not only that, but having different personalities in a group may also allow for easier problem solving.</p>
