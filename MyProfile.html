<p class="sectionContent"> Technology is something that I have been interested about since young, so the decision to study Information Technology in RMIT University came naturally. Technology is immerging over the years and fortunately, I am in the right era to be able to learn and observe how big of an impact echnology has on the world today. My interest started when I was in high school learning about how cloud services can affect the future work force or even benefit companies that are venturing into technology. That made me want to learn more about the fundamentals behind it. Where technology will potentially be in 20 years’ time intrigues me, and it’s exciting to be in involved in technology because it allows me to point my career in any direction.
<p class="sectionContent">The person who has inspired me the most is my uncle who is the Senior Client Executive/Director at a large IT company. He has never failed to give me advice on what skills and courses are in demand by IT companies which will broaden my opportunities. </p>


	    <p class="sectionContent">I chose to pursue my degree in RMIT because it is a modern university that offers a wide range of practical experiences instead of just theory. RMIT also focuses on work internship that will be beneficial to me when I’m out in the work force. RMIT also has a strong focus on preparing students on emerging trends, which will equip me with the necessary skills for my future.</li>
      </p>

	 <p class="sectionContent">I expect to learn new skills that will not only be beneficial to me in the working world, but also help me develop as a student in the university. Studying in this course will help me to discover what I’m passionate about and learn how to adapt to changes. It will encourage me to reflect on my best qualities as well as my weaknesses, and to build my self-confidence along the way.</p>
